# 📰 News Popularity Intelligence System  
### Transformer-Based Deep Learning for Editorial Ranking
---
## 📌 Project Overview

Digital news platforms must decide which articles to promote or deprioritize at publishing time.  
However, real engagement metrics (clicks, shares, impressions) are not available immediately.
This project treats **popularity as a latent variable** and infers it directly from text using:
- Transformer-based semantic embeddings (DistilBERT)
- Representation learning
- Clustering-based pseudo popularity groups
- Weak supervision using proxy signals
- Explainable AI reasoning
- Streamlit deployment
